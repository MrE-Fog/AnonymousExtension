		<div class="section">
			Anonymous Extension works by filtering out requests made by your browser to make sure the ones with personal information can't get through.
			This includes common tracking services, like google analytics and doubleclick.net (a common ad provider).

		<div class="sectionTitle">How do I know it's working?</div>
		<div class="section">
			Click <a href="https://google-analytics.com" target="_blank">here</a>, if the page says "Blocked by an Extension" its working! If not something might
			be wrong and you should probably try re-installing this extension.
