# Anonymous Extension

### A kgsensei Project

## Overview:

AnonymousExtension is a Edge and Chrome browser extension designed to make the internet a safer place for you. I was browsing the internet recently and looking at the crazy amount of trackers in some websites, there are like 20 in some websites alone... Like why? So I decided to build this web extension to block trackers, ip grabbers and some dangerous websites I know about.

Get it today on the Edge Store: [HERE](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/anonymous-extension/cdiiogmchafjebbdjgbchpdeoghfbocp)
