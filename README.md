# Anonymous Extension

Anonymous Extension is a kgsensei project and is Copyright &copy; of kgsensei 2022.

## Overview:

AnonymousExtension is a Edge and Chrome browser extension designed to make the internet a safer place for you. I was browsing the internet recently and looking at the crazy amount of trackers in some websites, there are like 20 in some websites alone... Like why? So I decided to build this web extension to block trackers, ip grabbers and some dangerous websites I know about.

## New in v3.0

Since the start of this project I have wanted to move to a server-client project base. In version 3 the I finally did it! When there is a version mismatch detected between the client and the server it will automatically update and cache the domain blacklist. This will be super helpful in the future for updating the extension. This might mark the last major update in a while due to how much it can be updated w/o needing approval to update it in markets.

The official Anonymous Extension website is kinda lame right now so I plan on updating that soon too. It will hopefully look more professional and explain how it works a little better. The site needs a little bit of maintenance too.
