# Anonymous Extension

Anonymous Extension is a kgsensei project and is Copyright &copy; of kgsensei 2023.

## Overview:

AnonymousExtension is a Edge and Chrome browser extension designed to make the internet a safer place for you. I was browsing the internet recently and looking at the crazy amount of trackers in some websites, there are like 30 in some websites alone... Like why? So I decided to build this web extension to block trackers, ip grabbers, and some other dangerous websites I know about.

It's really simple and easy to use, a true plug and play extension!

## New in v4

In Anonymous Extension version 4 I updated the code a bunch. Top level viewports will no longer be blocked... ever! This means that Anonymous Extension will work in the background even more than it used to furthering its ability as a productivity extension. It will still block all the old trackers and even more in the next month or two! A feature I had to get rid of due to manifest v3 is back (kind of). The number of trackers blocked on any specific page will be viewable on the extension icon. I also updated the UI a ton and made it much more visually appealing, at least to me!
