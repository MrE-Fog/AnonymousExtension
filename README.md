# Anonymous Extension

### A kgsensei Project

## Overview:

AnonymousExtension is a Edge and Chrome browser extension designed to make the internet a safer place for you. I was browsing the internet recently and looking at the crazy amount of trackers in some websites, there are like 20 in some websites alone... Like why? So I decided to build this web extension to block trackers, ip grabbers and some dangerous websites I know about.

Get it today on the Edge Store: [HERE](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/anonymous-extension/cdiiogmchafjebbdjgbchpdeoghfbocp)
If you need help setting up join the support discord: [here](https://discord.gg/U5A3QWXZKZ).

## DEV UPDATE

Since the announcement of Manifest v3 I have update the extension multiple times to try and 
accomidate for this change. In recent updates the filtering system has become much more strict
and may end up needing a recode. Please let me know if any issues arrise. The enable/disable
feature will not work for a little while.

Here are just some of the things it blocks:
